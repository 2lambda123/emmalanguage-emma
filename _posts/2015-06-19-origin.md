**Basic Idea:** *define data-parallel dataflows using second-order operators*, first advocated by MapReduce with a fixed 
dataflow structure (a map followed by a reduce);

```scala
def MapReduce[I,K,V,O](m: I => DataSet[(K,V)], r: DataSet[(K,V)] => DataSet[O])(input: DataSet[I]) = 
  input
    .flatMap(m)     // map phase
    .groupBy(_._1)  // group (shuffle) phase
    .groupReduce(r) // reduce phase
```    
## Generalization (I)

**Basic Idea:** Use a set of second-order operators (e.g., `map`, `reduce`, `join`, `coGroup`) as *primitives* that 
can be used to assemble parallel dataflows with arbitrary shape (i.e., beyond pure MapReduce) in a general-purpose 
host language (e.g., Java, Scala, Python);

```scala
def BeyondMapReduceI(students: DataSet[S], enrollments: DataSet[T]) = 
  (students join enrollments) where { _.matrNr } equalsTo { _.matrNr }
    .map(pair => (pair._1.matrNr, pair._2.grade, 1))
    .groupBy(_._1) // group by matrNr
    .reduce((x, y) => (x._1, x._2 + y._2, x._3 + y._3))
    .map(x => (x._1, x._2 / x._3))
```    

## Generalization (II)

**Basic Idea:** Expose idioms pertaining to the mode of execution (data-parallel on shared-nothing), but orthogonal 
to the concept above (e.g., *broadcast variables* accessed in UDF closures, *control flow*) as additional API constructs.

```scala
def BeyondMapReduceII(students: DataSet[S], enrollments: DataSet[T], interested: DataSet[Int]) = {
  
  val filteredStudents = students.filter(new RichFilterFunction() {
    var interested: Seq[Int] = null
    def open() = {
      interested = getExecutionContext().getBroadcastSet("interested")
    }
    def filter(x: (Int, Double)) = interested.contains(x._1)
  }).withBroadcastSet(interested, "interested")
  
  (filteredStudents join enrollments) where { _.matrNr } equalsTo { _.matrNr }
    .map(pair => (pair._1.matrNr, pair._2.grade, 1))
    .groupBy(_._1) // group by matrNr
    .reduce((x, y) => (x._1, x._2 + y._2, x._3 + y._3)).withForwardedFields(0)
    .map(x => (x._1, x._2 / x._3))
}
```

The peculiar way of expressing basic logic due to **Genralization (I)** and **(II)** is entangled with the complexity 
of the algorithm you want to program. If you are unfamiliar with the API and/or the algorithm logic, you will have 
to constantly think about both the algorithmic and the coding aspect in order to produce code which is both correct 
and high-quality.
